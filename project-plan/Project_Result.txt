Project Result:
The Van Oenen University in Groningen, Netherlands wants to attract more students with a more modern and inviting Website. The university itself is equipped with contemporary facilities and material to provide the newest education for students. 
The website should be suitable for the university and attract national, even international students to their student program.
To realize that, the contractor (IT1B) needs to create a Website which meets the expactation of the Client (Mr. Van Oenen). In this case the contractor has to provide a fully functional Website with an unique and stylish design, an RSS-feed, photos of the university and the location, a logic navigation and an external API. The default langauge should be english but the user should be able to switch to german and vice versa.
This, and extra functionalities, like requesting care packages for students, an online appointment system with their assigned coordinator and a form for visiting the university, will raise the amount of students at the Van Oenen University drastically, also caused by the improvements and maintenance which the contractor needs to fullfill. In addition to that, the client would like to have a logo with the initials of the University.

The goal is compatible with the SMART requirements, which means that the goal is meant to be specific, in our case to attract more students at the Van Oenen University and improve their satisfaction, measurable in expectation of a significate rise of students, increasing yearly, realistic for the reason that everyone owns a laptop or a smartphone which makes a website the best type to address students nationally and internationally and finally time bound which you can find in Chapter 1.1.
